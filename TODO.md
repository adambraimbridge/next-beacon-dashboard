SOONER

- Haikro + codeship setup
- Unit tests around params middleware
- Add help system w/ feedback

LATER

- Think of a nice way to expose AB test data
- Render page timings (these might be broken in next-beacon-component) library
- Add some redshift / content api data
- Drop-down filters by time/interval
- Drop-down filters by device class - Eg, mobile / tablet / desktop (might need to collect more data to ascertain the device type)
- Do something with the latest events stream, https://keen.io/docs/data-analysis/extractions/
- Visualise the CTA data - Eg, menu button clicks
