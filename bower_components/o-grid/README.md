# o-grid

## About

o-grid defines a 12 column responsive, nestable grid system for laying out html pages and modules.
It supports all browsers with support for *css media queries*, with two sizes of fixed-width fallback for browsers that don't support them (specifically ie7/8).

# Browser support
This module has been verified in Internet Explorer 7+, modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, ...) and mobile browsers (Android browser, iOS safari, Chrome mobile).

### Grid dimensions

Four layout sizes are defined:

* **Small**  
For screen widths less than 600px wide, including pretty much all mobiles  
Top level grid rows are fluid, ranging from 240px to 600px in width

* **Medium**  
For screen widths between 600px and 1000px, small tablets and tablets in portrait mode  
Top level grid rows are a fixed 780px width

* **Large**  
For screen widths between 1000px and 1400px, larger tablets and desktop  
Top level grid rows are a fixed 960px width

* **Extra Large**  
For screen widths above 1400px, large desktop  
Top level grid rows are a fixed 1360px width

All pixel sizes are CSS pixels, not physical pixels. To see which layout sizes will show on a particular device, you must take into account the device's pixel density.

For each of these the available horizontal width is separated into 12 columns. In addition, for nested grids the parent box's width is divided into 12 columns.

## General use

### Base classes
Grid styles are typically applied to the html using two types declaration:

* A `o-grid-row` class, added to the container element.  
It forces that element to extend to the maximum width available (either the maximum width defined by the grid, or the parent element's width if using a nested grid)

* A `data-o-grid-colspan` attribute, added to the element intended to conform to the grid's columns.  
`data-o-grid-colspan=""` by itself floats an element to the left. Specific widths are specified by setting the value of the attribute (see below for more details)  

So, for example

    <div class="o-grid-row">
        <div data-o-grid-colspan="6">A div spanning 6 grid columns</div>
    </div>

### Specifying column widths
The grid is divided into 12 columns and column instances can span any number of these 'grid-columns'. As the grid is responsive a different number of columns can be specified for each size of layout individually.
    
* {0-12} - specifies the number of columns to span by default
* S{0-12} - specifies the number of columns to span at the small layout
* M{0-12} - specifies the number of columns to span at the medium layout
* L{0-12} - specifies the number of columns to span at the large layout
* XL{0-12} - specifies the number of columns to span at the extra large layout

In general prefer to set the default for larger layouts and override for smaller ones as this means your module will probably display better if the grid is ever updated to allow additional larger layouts. If no default value is specified the element will simply take `width:auto` at any layout for which an explicit rule is not defined.

### Examples
    
A full width column for all sizes except large screens, where it takes up 9 columns

    <div data-o-grid-colspan="12 XL9"></div>  
  
A half width column for all sizes except small screens, where it takes up full width

    <div data-o-grid-colspan="6 S12"></div>  
  
A column which gradually takes up a greater portion of horizontal space as the screen gets smaller

    <div data-o-grid-colspan="S4 M3 L2 XL1"></div>  

A column which has width:auto except on small screens, where it takes up half the available width

    <div data-o-grid-colspan="S6"></div>  
  
### Utilities

#### Shorthand for single column layout
To avoid having to use the following inefficient markup

    <div class="o-grid-row">
       <div data-o-grid-colspan="12">
       </div>
    </div>

The following markup can be used instead

    <div class="o-grid-row" data-o-grid-colspan="12">
    </div>

#### Hiding elements

e.g. `data-o-grid-colspan="Mhide Shide"` will hide the given element for medium and small screen sizes even if the element isn't laid out as a column

#### Compact, gutterless rows
*(Note: unimplemented for the default media-queryless layout)*
To remove gutters from all columns in a row use the class `o-grid-row-compact`  e.g.

    <div class="o-grid-row o-grid-row-compact"></div>

#### Placeholder classes/`@extend`

[Placeholder classes](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#placeholders) can be extended in your sass and enable styling of elements according to the grid without having to add classes to the html. All class selectors have a placeholder class equivalent and these *must* always be used instead of classes when extending e.g. 
    
    .main {
        @extend %o-grid-row;
        // not @extend .o-grid-row
    }

##### Placeholders for columns

Placeholders for column selectors are of the format `%o-grid-colspan-[{S|M|L|XL}]{0-12|hide}` e.g.
        
    .aside {
        @extend %o-grid-col; // required in order to have the base column styles
        @extend %o-grid-colspan-4;
        @extend %o-grid-colspan-S12;
    }

There is no need to use these inside a media query - the placeholder classes are already included within the appropriate media query.

##### Fine-grained gutter removal
*(Note: unimplemented for the default media-queryless layout)*
To remove gutters from a specific column include these mixins passing the layout size. If you don't pass a parameter, it will be applied to the default layout size.

    @include oGridRemoveGutters({S|M|L|XL});
    @include oGridRemoveGuttersLeft({S|M|L|XL});
    @include oGridRemoveGuttersRight({S|M|L|XL});

e.g. 

        // no left gutter at large and extra large layouts. No gutter at all at small size
        .my-component {
            @include oGridRemoveGuttersLeft(L);
            @include oGridRemoveGuttersRight(XL);
            @include oGridRemoveGutters(S);
        }

        //No gutter at any size
        .my-other-component {
            @include oGridRemoveGutters();
        }

If silent mode is turned off, you can also do this by applying classes to your columns that have the following structure (the parts in square brackets are optional):

    .o-grid-remove-gutters[--{left|right}][--{S|M|L|XL}]

#### Mixins
* `oGridRespondTo($layoutSize)`  
To create styles that respond to the same breakpoints as the grid, this Sass mixin can be used to wrap the styles in the appropriate media query. It should be passed `S`, `M`, `L` or `XL` depending on which layout size the style should apply to e.g.

        @include oGridRespondTo(S) {
            .o-example-module .item-subheading {
                font-size: 0.5em
            }
        }

More than one layout can be passed in at once (enabling applying the same styles to e.g. both extra large and large layouts).
        
        @include oGridRespondTo(L XL) {
            .o-example-module .item-subheading {
                font-size: 0.5em
            }
        }

* `oGridTargetAtFixedLayout()`  
This applies styles only when the large screen fixed layout (typically used as the ie8 fallback) is active
        
        @include oGridTargetAtFixedLayout() {
            .o-header {
                position: static;
            }
        }

#### Variables
All the variables used by the grid (see src/scss/_variables.scss) can be used in your own sass stylesheets but *must not* be overwritten at the component/module level.


### Gotchas

#### Fixed/Absolute positioning
Widths are specified in percentages, which will not work for fixed or absolute positioned elements (The grid can however be used to layout elements within an absolute/fixed position container). If you need to support fixed/absolutely position elements, or have developed yuor own solution, please leave a comment on the [github issue](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-grid-issues/issues/9).

## Product developers guide

### Laying out pages with the grid
The `o-grid-page` and `o-grid-box` classes are now deprecated and will be removed in next major release.

### Supporting legacy browsers
By default, any browser that doesn't support media queries will be served the small layout. This can be overridden so the large layout is shown instead. The default for triggering this large fixed layout is ie8 on desktop, but this is configurable using one of two variables

* `$o-grid-useragents-fixed-large: ie8 !default` - useragent names compatible with [o-useragent](http://git.svc.ft.com/tree/origami%2Fo-useragent.git/HEAD)
* `$o-grid-selector-fixed-large: null !default` - css selector. If specified will override the useragent targeting

### Things you *can* do (but in most cases probably shouldn't)
The grid is easy to configure by overwriting the default values of many of the sass variables. To do so simply specify a value for the given variable before you include o-grid's main.scss file. A few notable uses are as follows:

#### Changing how responsive the grid is
The following flags can be used to change the responsive behaviour *\[defaults in square brackets\]*

* `$o-grid-is-responsive`: \[true\] If set to false only the default is used. This greatly reduces the stylesheet file size and should be used for mobile only products
* `$o-grid-is-fluid`: \[true\] Switches between fully fluid and snapped grid layouts
* `$o-grid-is-fixed-large`: \[false\] Forces the site to always use the large layout
* `$o-grid-selector-fixed-large`: \[null\] Can be set to any class/selector so that the layout can be enabled for criteria other than the browser being ie8

#### Resizing the grid
By overwriting the values of any of the `$...width` or `$...gutter` variables the width and spacing of the grid at any of the layout sizes can be decreased or increased as required

#### Disabling larger layouts
By setting the value of a breakpoint (`$o-grid-small-max-width`, `$o-grid-medium-max-width` or `$o-grid-large-max-width`) to `false` the breakpoint is disabled, and its styles will not be included. *This only works when disabling a breakpoint **and** all those larger than it so, e.g. `$o-grid-medium-max-width: false;` will have unexpected efects on your layout unless you also specify `$o-grid-large-max-width: false;`.*
