    <h3>Event collections</h2>
    <p>
        Events are things that happen inside the Next system that we want to track. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We currently track two types of events :-
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>dwell - Indicates a user has stayed on a page for at least 5 seconds.</li>
        <li>cta (call-to-action) - Indicates a user has clicked on something on the Next user interface.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Viewing the events is as simple as using the <i>event_collection</i> parameter,
    </p>
    <pre>...com/graph?<b>event_collection=dwell</b></pre>

    <h3>Metrics</h2>
    <p>
        Metrics are ways to count the next events.
    </p>
    <p>
     Typically we want to find out how many times something has 
        happened, which you can do so with the <i>metric</i> parameter, 
    </p> 

    <pre>...com/graph?<b>metric=count</b></pre>

    <p>
        Often it's more useful to count the number of times something has happened per user, which 
        you can do as follows,
    </p>

    <pre>...com/graph?<b>metric=count_unique</b>&<b>target_property=user.erights</b></pre>
   
    <p>
        There's plently of <a href="https://keen.io/docs/data-analysis/metrics/">other metrics</a> documented in Keen.io
        although most of them pertain to specific types of data.
    </p>


    <h3>Time</h2>
    <p>
    
    Queries can be run over different time periods.

    See the Keen.io <a href="https://keen.io/docs/data-analysis/timeframe/">timeframe</a>
    and <a href="https://keen.io/docs/data-analysis/interval/">interval</a> guides for more information.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>timeframe - A timeframe is the period of time over which you want to run an analysis.
        <li>interval - In a timeseries, this is the duration of each timeframe - Eg, daily.
    </ul>

    <p>
    For example, yesterday's data in twenty-four hourly slices,
    </p>
    
    <pre>...com/graph?<b>timeframe=yesterday</b>&<b>interval=hourly</b></pre>
    
    <h3>Filters</h2>

    <p>
        Filters allow us to cut the results different ways. You can supply more than one filter.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>isStaff - true|false - Filters out FT staff members from the results.
        <li>pageType - stream|article|... - Filters the data to only that of a particular type of page.
        <li>uuid - Filters data to an individual CAPI UUID (aka. article)
        <li>eRights - Filters data to an individual eRights ID (aka. registered user)
        <li>flags - Filters data to a flag. Eg. useful to counting the number of users or behaviour around a flag.
        <li>domPathEquals - (cta only) - Filters data to match the full DOM path of a CTA action.
        <li>domPathContains - (cta only) - Filters data to match a sub-string of a DOM path. 
    </ul>

    <p>
        Filters can be combined like so,
    </p>

    <pre>...com/graph?<b>isStaff=false</b>&<b>uuid=90a6a11a-ef6c-11e1-9580-00144feabdc0</b></pre>
    
    <h3>Group by</h2>
    
    <p>
        Often you'll want to group the output of a query in to sets of results. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Adding a <i>group_by</i> parameter allows you to split the results in this way, Eg. We may want page views <i>grouped by</i>
        common browser family (Chrome, Firefox etc.)
    </p>
    
    <pre>...com/graph?<b>group_by=user.browser.family</b></pre>

    <h3>API</h3>

    <p>
        All data is available in time-series graph form for dashboards,
    </p>
  
    <pre>http://ft-next-beacon-dashboard.herokuapp.com/<b>graph</b>?...</pre>
    
    <p>
        Or JSON for programmatic access.
